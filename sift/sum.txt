This paper describes image feat ures that have many properties that make them suitable for matching differing images of an o bject or scene

In addition, the features are highly distinctive, which allows a single feature to be corr ectly matched with high probability against a large database of features, providing a basis for o bject and scene recognition

An important aspect of this approach is that it generates lar ge numbers of features that densely cover the image over the full range of scales and loca tions

The quantity of features is partic- ularly important for object recognition, where the ability to detect small objects in cluttered backgrounds requires that at least 3 features be correctly m atched from each object for reli- able identification

A new image is matched by individually comparing each feature from the new image to this previous database and finding candidate match- ing features based on Euclidean distance of their feature ve ctors

However, in a cluttered image, many features from the background will not have any co rrect match in the database, giving rise to many false matches in addition to the correct o nes
