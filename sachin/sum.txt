I guess this means the countdown has begun

It had been giving you signals - that permanently cracked bone in your toe, the struggle to get out of bed when the back played up, that elbow

This young fellow Kohli, for example, who plays with your intensity but whose vocabulary I guess you would struggle with

But then you were floating around in the batting order, spending too much time not being in the thick of it all

I can see why you were so desperate to open the batting in Auckland that day in 1994

) when you took the ball in the 50th over with just six to defend and delivered a win

The 163 in Christchurch, the 175 in Hyderabad, that 200 in Gwalior, the 120 in Bangalore, the 111 in Nagpur

That 100th hurt you, didn't it, as it did all of us, and I guess we didn't help you by not letting you forget

The mind still lingers on the time the two of you would come out at the start of a one-day international

(I watched one of those partnerships the other night and it seemed only the commercial breaks could stop you two

)  By now you were playing the lap shots more than the booming drives down the ground

"I want to play down the ground too," you told me, "that is why I am playing the paddle shot

That pull shot is as fresh in the memory as that first cover drive off Wasim Akram in the 2003 World Cup when you took strike because you thought the great man would have too many tricks for Sehwag

And your decision to keep the Player of the Tournament award in your restaurant because you would much rather have had the smaller winner's medal

It told me how much that meant to you, and when I saw the tears on your face that night in Mumbai, I instantly knew why

It was only Kenya the next day, but I can see why you rate that hundred

That is our first image of you - the curly hair, the confident look, the front foot strideâ€¦ all in white
