Google launched its latest own-brand smartphone with little fanfare

Almost everything about the Nexus 5's specification is top-drawer, from its Snapdragon 800 processor to its Full HD screen and the very latest version of Android; 4

The Nexus 5 is amazing value for a top-drawer smartphone, but if you're on a serious budget don’t forget about the Motorola Moto G: a fully-featured Android 4

You don’t get the super-classy build quality of the metal-and-glass Sony Xperia Z1 or the metal unibody HTC One, but the phone's chassis is classy enough to match its internal components

4  With benchmark figures like these, it's no surprise that the Google Nexus 5 runs Android 4

The redesigned, larger icons, more modern compressed fonts and coloured backgrounds make it look far more like a consumer interface than an engineer's plaything; stock Android has now caught up with the custom editions from Sony and Motorola for attractiveness

Swiping left from the main homescreen now goes straight to Google Now, which displays a number of cards relating to your recent activities on Google; if you've searched for a place on Google Maps, for example, if will automatically display a route based on whether you usually walk, drive or take public transport

There have also apparently been some improvements to the voice search; we found it worked reasonably well, letting us navigate to places with distinctive names (Leicester and Croydon were fine, Purley was more likely to take us to the East End of London than the South) but we'd still usually use it to call people when driving than for general smartphone tasks

4 is also more tightly integrated with Google+ than previous versions

Hangouts, the Google+ group chat app, is now the default for messaging, so you can choose whether to send an SMS to a phone number or a Hangout message to someone in your Google+ circles

If your contacts don’t use Hangouts on their phones the message will appear when they next log in to Google+, but strangely not in the notification area of the Google homepage

NEXUS 5 CAMERA  Google makes a big deal about the capabilities of the Nexus 5's camera, and it has some fun features

The results look largely the same, though its tendency to over exposure has been toned down, colours have been warmed up a little, and it looks fractionally sharper to our eyes

It’s a little grainier as well, so we imagine this has been a tweak to its noise-reduction algorithm

When filming outside in the street, we saw lifelike detail, strong colours and little noise in the 1080p footage, but the lack of optical image stabilisation means some camera shake is inevitable

First, the maximum volume of the speaker has been upped considerably, it’s now much louder turned up full, and though it starts to distort a little at maximum volume, it’s certainly a nice additional option for when you want to watch a YouTube video with a friend

The Google Nexus 5’s only drawback is battery life; it managed just 7h 22m in our video playback test, which is three hours less than we expect to see from a modern smartphone
